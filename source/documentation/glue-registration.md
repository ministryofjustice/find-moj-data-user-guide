# Adding metadata from the AWS Glue catalog to Find MoJ Data

Data stored in AWS Glue which is not processed via Create A Derived Table but needs to be added to the catalog requires the Find MoJ Data team to be contacted.

Please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-catalogue/issues) and supply the team with some information to add the database. Select "New issue" then "Add Glue database to the data catalogue".
